    This program gives a simple view of all the fonts on a machine (at least all the ones accessible to Java). 
Here are the features:

 - You can search through fonts using the searchbar at the top right of the application.
 
 - You can save the list of fonts to a file with the 'Save List' button. They will be saved into a file named 
   "font-list.txt" located where this application was run from.
  
 - You can reload the list of fonts using the 'Show List' when you're done searching.
   
 - You can change different properties of the sample text at the top of the page like its size and case.
   
 - You can also switch between the full and lite versions of the app. The LITE version (default) displays 
   all the fonts in the same font. The FULL version renders each font name with its respective font.
   The full version takes MUCH longer to load, and all fonts may not be rendered correctly. However, it's 
   the best option to see and compare all of the fonts easily.
   
   Any complaints and requests can be made to me at icyblaze16@gmail.com.
   I hope you find this app useful!
